Determine the possible characters that could result from a certain morse code word with some potentially unknown signals.

Morse Code
Morse Code is delivered in a series signals which are referred to as dashes (-) or dots (.). To keep things simple for the purposes of this challenge we'll only decode letters with a maximum length of three signals.

Morse Code Examples
-.- translates to K
... translates to S
.- translates to A
-- translates to M
. translates to E

Background
You've started work as morse code translator. Unfortunately some of the signals aren't as distinguishable as others and there are times where a . seems indistinguishable from -. In these cases you write down a ? so that you can figure out what all the posibilities of that letter for that word are later.

Task
Write a function possibilities that will take a string word and return an array of possible characters that the morse code word could represent.

Examples with ?
? should return ['E','T']
?. should return ['I','N']
.? should return ['I','A']
?-? should return ['R','W','G','O']
