You are given an even number of people num_people that stand around a circle and each person shakes hands with someone else, so that there are num_people / 2 handshakes total.

Return the number of ways these handshakes could occur such that none of the handshakes cross.

Since this number could be very big, return the answer mod 10^9 + 7 

Example 1:

Input: num_people = 2
Output: 1
